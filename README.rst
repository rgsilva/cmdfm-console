*This project has been discontinued (at least for now) because I'm too lazy to fix it. They changed how the frontend communicates with the backend, so it stopped working completely. Feel free to fix it if you want! :)*

cmd.fm console interface
========================

This is/was a very poor and basic console interface for the http://cmd.fm/.

Why?
~~~~

It was a boring night. My attempts to go out with girls failed and I was doing nothing useful. Eventually someone said somewhere about http://cmd.fm/. I kinda liked it. Then I asked myself (and a friend): "why not a REAL console interface (or something local at least)?". Well, that's why.

How?

Reverse engineering.

I did this project for fun. If the developers of cmd.fm ask me, I'll take it down. I'm not connected to them at all, so don't expect this to work forever and don't ask them for support. I might eventually discontinue this if I don't have time anymore. Bla bla bla, you got the idea! :)

Finally, please, if you like this, make sure to check the original and better service: http://cmd.fm/.
